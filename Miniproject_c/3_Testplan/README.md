The purpose of testing is to discover errors. Testing is the process of trying to
discover every conceivable fault or weakness in a work product. It provides a way
to check the functionality of components, sub assemblies, assemblies and/or a
finished product It is the process of exercising software with the intent of ensuring
that the Software system meets its requirements and user expectations and does not
fail in an unacceptable manner. There are various types of test. Each test type
addresses a specific testing requirement.
Types of tests:
Unit testing
Unit testing involves the design of test cases that validate that the internal program
logic is functioning properly, and that program inputs produce valid outputs. All
decision branches and internal code flow should be validated. It is the testing of
individual software units of the application .it is done after the completion of an
individual unit before integration. This is a structural testing, that relies on
knowledge of its construction and is invasive. Unit tests perform basic tests at
component level and test a specific business process, application, and/or system
configuration. Unit tests ensure that each unique path of a business process
performs accurately to the documented specifications and contains clearly defined
inputs and expected results.
Integration testing:
Integration tests are designed to test integrated software components to determine
if they actually run as one program. Testing is event driven and is more concerned
with the basic outcome of screens or fields. Integration tests demonstrate that
although the components were individually satisfied, as shown by successfully unit
testing, the combination of components is correct and consistent. Integration
testing is specifically aimed at exposing the problems that arise from the
combination of components.

Functional test:
Functional tests provide systematic demonstrations that functions tested are
available as specified by the business and technical requirements, system
documentation, and user manuals.
Functional testing is centered on the following items:
Valid Input: identified classes of valid input must be accepted.
Invalid Input: identified classes of invalid input must be rejected.
Functions: identified functions must be exercised.
Output: identified classes of application outputs must be exercised.
Systems/Procedures: interfacing systems or procedures must be invoked.
Organization and preparation of functional tests is focused on requirements, key
functions, or special test cases. In addition, systematic coverage pertaining to
identify Business process flows; data fields, predefined processes, and successive
processes must be considered for testing. Before functional testing is complete,
additional tests are identified and the effective value of current tests is determined.
System Test:
System testing ensures that the entire integrated software system meets
requirements. It tests a configuration to ensure known and predictable results. An
example of system testing is the configuration oriented system integration test.
System testing is based on process descriptions and flows, emphasizing pre-driven
process links and integration points.
White Box Testing:
White Box Testing is a testing in which the software tester has knowledge of the
inner workings, structure and language of the software, or at least its purpose. It is
purposeful. It is used to test areas that cannot be reached from a black box level.

Black Box Testing:
Black Box Testing is testing the software without any knowledge of the inner
workings, structure or language of the module being tested. Black box tests, as
most other kinds of tests, must be written from a definitive source document, such
as specification or requirements document, such as specification or requirements
document. It is a testing in which the software under test is treated as a black box
.you cannot “see” into it. The test provides inputs and responds to outputs without
considering how the software works.
Acceptance Testing:
User Acceptance Testing is a critical phase of any project and requires significant
participation by the end user. It also ensures that the system meets the functional
requirements.
